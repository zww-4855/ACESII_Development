C Originally the root was pass in as an argument. It is supposed to
C be an array but it never was. The other problem was that
C it was a double precision in the calling routine(STARTV) and
C integer here. Moreover, the root was not used for anything. So I 
C comment it until someone come up with a use for it. Ajith September, 1997.
